# 🧠 Python 3 – World 3: Data Structures, Functions, and Error Handling

This repository gathers the studies, exercises, and projects developed during **World 3** of the Python 3 course.  
In this module, I deepened my knowledge of **data structures**, **functions**, **modularization**, and **error handling** — fundamental pillars for writing cleaner, more organized, and professional code.

## 📚 Topics Covered

### 📦 Data Structures
I learned how to use **tuples**, **lists**, and **dictionaries**, understanding the importance of each structure and when to use them in projects.

- ✅ **Tuples**: immutable, lightweight, and ideal for fixed data.
- ✅ **Lists**: versatile and mutable, great for dynamic collections.
- ✅ **Dictionaries**: key-value data storage, essential for complex structures.

> Each lesson was accompanied by practical exercises that helped solidify concepts and apply knowledge to real-life situations.

### 🔁 Functions, Modules, and Packages
Modularization is key for scalable projects. In this module, I learned to:

- ✅ Create **custom functions** to avoid code repetition.
- ✅ Structure projects with **modules** and **reusable packages**.
- ✅ Organize applications into **logical components**.

> The lessons simulated real-world projects, making the learning experience practical and applicable.

### ⚠️ Error Handling
I learned to handle exceptions professionally, making my code more **secure**, **robust**, and **fault-tolerant**.

- Using `try`, `except`, `else`, `finally`
- Input validation
- Checking file and website accessibility
- Creating menus and working with files in Python
