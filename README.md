# 🐍 Complete Python 3 Course – My Programming Journey

This repository documents my entire journey through the **“Python 3 – World 1, 2, and 3”** course, taught by Professor Gustavo Guanabara on the Curso em Vídeo channel.  
The course aims to **introduce, consolidate, and expand the fundamentals of the Python language** in a practical, didactic, and progressive way, using **exercises, challenges, and gamification** as learning tools.

## 🎓 About the Course

The course is divided into three worlds (main modules), each focusing on a specific stage of learning:

| Module  | Main Content                          | Focus                                              | Status     |
|---------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|------------|
| 🌍 World 1 | Introduction to Programming with Python | Basic concepts, data types, input/output, operators, and conditionals | ✅ Completed |
| 🌍 World 2 | Flow Control and Loop Structures     | `for`, `while` loops, conditional logic, break/continue, nesting, and repetition patterns | ✅ Completed |
| 🌍 World 3 | Data Structures, Functions, and Errors | Lists, tuples, dictionaries, functions, modules, packages, and exception handling | ✅ Completed |

## 📚 What I Learned

- ✅ Programming Logic and Computational Thinking  
- ✅ Primitive types, string manipulation, and mathematical operators  
- ✅ Conditional structures (`if`, `else`, `elif`)  
- ✅ Loop structures (`for`, `while`, `break`, `continue`)  
- ✅ Data manipulation and analysis with lists, tuples, and dictionaries  
- ✅ Code modularization with functions, modules, and packages  
- ✅ Error handling techniques and building robust systems  
- ✅ Creating menus, simulations, small systems, and simple terminal games

## 🎮 Gamified Methodology

One of the course’s standout features is its **playful approach**: each lesson acts as a “level” to be completed.  
This made learning motivating, giving me a constant sense of progress, even without a prior IT background.

The course also offers extra materials, organized playlists, and optional challenges for content reinforcement.

## 🚀 Why Python?

Python is a modern, clear, and powerful language, widely used in areas such as:

- Web Development  
- Data Analysis and Data Science  
- Automation  
- Machine Learning and AI  
- Scripting and rapid prototyping  

Choosing Python prepared me not only for personal projects but also to confidently enter the tech job market.
