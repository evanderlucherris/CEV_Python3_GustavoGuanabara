# 🌍 Python 3 – World 2: Loops and Flow Control Structures

After completing the first module of the course, I moved on to **World 2**, where I fully immersed myself in Python’s **flow control** and **loop structures**. At this stage of the journey, I learned to master fundamental commands like `if`, `else`, `elif`, `for`, and `while`, which are the backbone of any program that makes decisions or performs repeated actions.

Just like in World 1, the methodology remains gamified, making learning lighter and more practical. The lessons were structured in a clear and progressive way, making it easier to absorb even more challenging topics.

## 🧠 What did I learn in this module?

- **Conditions:** Using `if`, `elif`, and `else` for decision-making.
- **Loop structures:** Creating repetitions with `for` and `while`.
- **Best practices:** Tips to avoid pitfalls and write clean code.
- **Real-world applications:** Exercises based on day-to-day programming situations.

## ✅ My Progress

Throughout the module, I completed over **40 practical exercises**, such as:

- 🧮 Interactive menu using `while`
- 🐍 Fibonacci sequence
- 🎮 Rock, Paper, Scissors game
- 🏦 ATM simulation
- 📊 Group analysis and statistics

Other topics covered:

- Input validation
- Prime numbers
- Counters and accumulators
- Loops with stop conditions (flags)

## 🚀 Conclusion

This module was essential for strengthening my programming logic and preparing me for more complex challenges. By deeply understanding how to use conditional and loop structures, I was able to create more dynamic and intelligent programs.

If you're learning Python, I highly recommend completing World 1 before diving into this one. With a solid foundation, World 2 becomes even more rewarding!
